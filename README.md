# Salary-Slip
Prints the payroll of a desired employee and stores employee personal information into a file

This short "project" was used to get me some experience with object oriented programming. 
I learned how to use classes and nested classes as well as the importance of private and public classifications.

Previously I never saw a point of private classifications but after doing the project I understood why it could be extremely important as projects get scaled up.

Another thing that I realized was how much better my previous bank management project could be improved with object oriented programming. The other project was very messy with variables flying everywhere, but after doing this mini project, it felt like I could half the size of the bank management project. It was easy to keep track of variables and functions, and rarely did I have hiccups while doing the project.

However, these two projects demonstrate to me the inefficiencies of c++'s file system. It's very hard to edit and extract data compared to python.

Still, this project was extremely informative.
